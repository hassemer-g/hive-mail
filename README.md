TL;DR: Download everything, maintaining folder structure; then simply run "hive_mail.js" with Node.js. Follow console instructions. Enjoy.

Let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvement (just write to me on Hive).

Required Node.js packages:
- @hiveio/dhive
- @noble/ciphers
- @noble/hashes
- bs58
- node-base91
- pqclean
- readline-sync
